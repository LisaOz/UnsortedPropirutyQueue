# UnsortedPropirutyQueue

This code is an implementation of a Priority Queue using an **unsorted list**.
The **priority queue** stores elements in an unsorted list, and the element with the highest priority (smallest value) is retrieved or removed during operations.

*Example*:
Input elements (unsorted): 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Processing in order of priority: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

The implementation supports adding elements, retrieving the smallest element (peek), and removing elements in priority order (poll).
